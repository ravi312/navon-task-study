    <label>1) How well do you think you did, out of 100% (with 1 being terrible, and 100 being perfect)? </label>

    <label>2) In 1-2 sentences, what do you think this experiment was testing?</label><br>
    <textarea id="q2" name="q2" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea><br>

    <label>3) We know it is generally difficult to stay focused in these online experiments.  On a scale of 1-100 (with 1 being very distracted, and 100 being very focused), how well did you pay attention to the experiment? (This will not affect whether you receive credit or compensation)
