            <h3>Student Consent</h3>
            Thank-you for considering participation in this research study. Please note that your participation is voluntary. Additional text may be there at the bottom of the page depending on the magnification or screen size of the computer. Hence, you may need to use the scroll to read the entire instruction on the page.  The following points provide information about the study. <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Purpose:</b> The study is about understanding whether and how academic/textbook language affects the attention of students. </li>
                <li><b>Procedures:</b> You will be asked to complete a computerized task that involves identifying alphabets displayed on your computer screen and selecting a response based on the task instructions indicated. Responses may involve making choices, performing a mental task (e.g., memorizing information), and/or performing a physical action (e.g., pressing a button on your keyboard, dragging a mouse etc.). At the conclusion of the experiment, you would be asked to complete a brief demographics information sheet, as well as some questions related to the experimental task. Following the experiment, you will be debriefed on the specific objectives of the experiment.</li>
                <li><b>Time Commitment:</b> This study will be completed in one session lasting between 30-45 minutes.</li>
                <li><b>Compensation:</b> There is no compensation for participating in this study.</li>
                <li><b>Risks:</b> There are no known risks involved in the study.</li>
                <li><b>Benefits:</b> You may not directly benefit from participating in this study. However, the results gained by participation in this research will be useful as they would provide a better understanding of how reading academic language influences attention and by extension, comprehension.</li>
                <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> The research team will make every effort to ensure that any information you share with us is kept confidential and is used only for the purpose of this study. Data from this study may be shared with other members of the research team for research purposes. Under those conditions, only de-identified data (i.e., data without participant names or other sensitive/identifying information) will be shared. For your privacy, your consent forms will not be linked to the main data file. All data obtained during the course of this research will be stored on virus-protected computers. Additionally, access to any/all data files will be restricted by using passwords. Please also note that if the results of this study are used to write scientific publications (e.g., research reports, journal articles etc.) or to present at scientific meetings, your name will not be disclosed. This means that only aggregated results/findings will be reported/presented. </li>
                <li><b>Voluntary:</b> Please understand that your decision to take part in this study is entirely voluntary. This means that you have the right to refuse to participate or to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are normally entitled. </li>
